Using pipenv as a dependency & virtual environment manager.

Install all existing dependencies using:

```
pipenv install
```

Now you can run the script with the dependencies ready to go:

```
pipenv run python ssd.py
```

Or access the environment shell itself, and run commands from in there:

```
pipenv shell
```

To add new dependencies, use:

```
pipenv install package_name_here
```
